# Branch Note

## About this branch (`dev-branch`)

This branch is mainly to facilitate pull requests to the `main` branch.

## Some courtesies

Please sign your commit messages with a `---YOUR_NAME`.
Obviously replace `YOUR_NAME` with, well, the name you usually use here.
Makes verifying less of a headache.
It would also help to end your commit messages with `[RELEASE_TARGET]`.
Again, replace `RELEASE_TARGET` with the current version release target (e.g. v1.1.0, 1.2.0, etc.).
